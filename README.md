This project was created for the purpose of learning and getting myself geared up for my first ever quite complete programming project. 
Yes, indeed it was an assignment. Nevertheless, I had poured in countless days and efforts into this and had many helps from a friend of mine, @Zikeji who very generously taught and guided me throughout the project.
There were some restriction behind the requirements, ridiciously database were simply out of question and we all had to rely on text files to store any information. In which case, I did some research and find out GSON (Google's JSON) is my perfect gateway for managing the data which turns out suprising well and very easy to use.
